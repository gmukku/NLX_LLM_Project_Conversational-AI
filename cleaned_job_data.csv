Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

"Detail-oriented Frontend Developer with a strong passion for crafting visually appealing and user-friendly web interfaces. With over 4 years of experience, I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with expertise in frontend frameworks such as React.js and Vue.js. Proficient in translating design mockups into pixel-perfect implementations, I ensure seamless user experiences across devices and browsers. Skilled in state management with Redux and Vuex, I efficiently manage application states and data flows. Additionally, I have experience in responsive design and accessibility, following best practices to create inclusive and accessible web applications. A proactive learner, I stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in frontend development, continuously improving my skills to deliver high-quality solutions.",Senior Frontend Developer,"Malmö, Sweden",,"PinMeTo helps businesses connect with their customers on the biggest search, map, and social media platforms. Our SaaS platform integrates directly with platforms like Apple, Facebook, Google, Instagram and more, and enables multi location brands to effectively manage their presence on them.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

Actively participating in frontend development communities and design forums to share knowledge and collaborate with peers.",Senior Frontend Developer,"Malmö, Sweden",,"PinMeTo helps businesses connect with their customers on the biggest search, map, and social media platforms. Our SaaS platform integrates directly with platforms like Apple, Facebook, Google, Instagram and more, and enables multi location brands to effectively manage their presence on them.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

"Passionate Data Scientist with a focus on leveraging data to drive strategic decisions and business growth. With 5 years of experience, I specialize in using Python and R for statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Proficient in libraries like pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, I preprocess and explore data to extract meaningful insights. Skilled in machine learning algorithms and frameworks such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow, I develop predictive models for various use cases, including customer segmentation and churn prediction. Additionally, I have experience in deploying models in production using platforms like AWS and Azure. A proactive problem solver, I thrive in collaborative environments, leveraging my analytical skills to solve complex business challenges.","Senior Data Scientist (Remote, PhD Required)","New York, NY, USA",US$140K–US$170K a year,"Our platform involves ingesting and modeling hundreds of thousands of high-resolution timeseries, updated at 15-minute intervals. We're looking for candidates who have experience building high-velocity machine learning systems from scratch.

• Build advanced timeseries forecasting models at scale. Our customers depend on us to reliably forecast energy demand, both short term and long term, at... micro and macro levels.

• We use a combination of classical timeseries techniques as well as modern ML. We're not big on deep learning, but we're open to the possibility.

• Energy demand and generation both depend on climate and weather, so be prepared to learn lots about meteorology!

• We are primarily Python based, but it's early days, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure.

Our engineering team is still quite small, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure. We are strong supporters of open source and we encourage our employees to publish and give talks about the work they do at Amperon.

NOTE PhD required for this role

Perks

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

• Build advanced timeseries forecasting models at scale. Our customers depend on us to reliably forecast energy demand, both short term and long term, at... micro and macro levels.

• We use a combination of classical timeseries techniques as well as modern ML. We're not big on deep learning, but we're open to the possibility.

• Energy demand and generation both depend on climate and weather, so be prepared to learn lots about meteorology!

• We are primarily Python based, but it's early days, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure.

We're looking for candidates who have experience building high-velocity machine learning systems from scratch.

• Build advanced timeseries forecasting models at scale. Our customers depend on us to reliably forecast energy demand, both short term and long term, at... micro and macro levels.

• We use a combination of classical timeseries techniques as well as modern ML. We're not big on deep learning, but we're open to the possibility.

• Energy demand and generation both depend on climate and weather, so be prepared to learn lots about meteorology!

• We are primarily Python based, but it's early days, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure.

Our engineering team is still quite small, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure. We are strong supporters of open source and we encourage our employees to publish and give talks about the work they do at Amperon.

NOTE PhD required for this role

Perks

It’s a company filled with smart, genuinely nice individuals who are passionate about data science, energy and working together to build a product that can have a lasting impact on our planet.

Even though we are a remote company with employees spread across the globe, we still believe human interaction is a good thing. All new employees will fly out to meet their manager within a month of being hired. We will also have an all-company event at least once a year so people can get to know each other in a more fun and social way.

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

Led projects such as developing content management systems with Angular, building progressive web apps with SvelteKit, and optimizing web accessibility with ARIA attributes. Also contributed to projects including implementing internationalization and localization features, and integrating with backend APIs for data retrieval. Actively participating in frontend developer communities and contributing to open-source projects to share knowledge and collaborate with peers.",Senior Frontend Developer,"Malmö, Sweden",,"PinMeTo helps businesses connect with their customers on the biggest search, map, and social media platforms. Our SaaS platform integrates directly with platforms like Apple, Facebook, Google, Instagram and more, and enables multi location brands to effectively manage their presence on them.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

Hewlett Packard Enterprise

Technology innovation that fosters business transformation.

We Are In the Acceleration Business

We help customers use technology to slash the time it takes to turn ideas into value. In turn, they transform industries, markets and lives.

Some of our customers run traditional IT environments. Most are transitioning to a secure, cloud-enabled, mobile-friendly infrastructure. Many rely on a combination of both. Wherever they are in that journey, we provide the technology and solutions to help them succeed.

COVID Policy

The health and safety of our team members, customers and partners is paramount at HPE. Accordingly, if applicable to the role you applied to, you must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by the employment start date where permitted by law.

Edge-to-Office – our hybrid way of working

Edge-to-Office is HPE's hybrid work environment that focuses on flexibility and trust. Most team members work from the edge (primarily outside the office), and some, where deemed essential to performing their role, are allocated a workstation in an HPE office. Regardless of whether a team member is edge or office, all team members are welcome to use our sites for culture and collaboration. Country specific regulations may apply.

Our SaaS platform integrates directly with platforms like Apple, Facebook, Google, Instagram and more, and enables multi location brands to effectively manage their presence on them.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

Our team members search beyond customers' needs today to accelerate what’s next and make a difference — for others, our company, and the planet. Our customers turn to us because we are positive, empathetic and enterprising.

At Workday, it all began with a conversation over breakfast. When our founders met at a sunny California diner, they came up with an idea to revolutionize the enterprise software market. And when we began to rise, one thing that really set us apart was our culture. A culture which was driven by our value of putting our people first. And ever since, the happiness, development, and contribution of every Workmate is central to who we are.

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

Actively participating in data science communities and forums to share knowledge and collaborate with peers.","Senior Data Scientist (Remote, PhD Required)","New York, NY, USA",US$140K–US$170K a year,"Our platform involves ingesting and modeling hundreds of thousands of high-resolution timeseries, updated at 15-minute intervals. We're looking for candidates who have experience building high-velocity machine learning systems from scratch.

• Build advanced timeseries forecasting models at scale. Our customers depend on us to reliably forecast energy demand, both short term and long term, at... micro and macro levels.

• We use a combination of classical timeseries techniques as well as modern ML. We're not big on deep learning, but we're open to the possibility.

• Energy demand and generation both depend on climate and weather, so be prepared to learn lots about meteorology!

• We are primarily Python based, but it's early days, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure.

Our engineering team is still quite small, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure. We are strong supporters of open source and we encourage our employees to publish and give talks about the work they do at Amperon.

NOTE PhD required for this role

Perks

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

Actively attending frontend conferences and workshops to stay updated with the latest trends and technologies.",Senior Frontend Developer,"Malmö, Sweden",,"PinMeTo helps businesses connect with their customers on the biggest search, map, and social media platforms. Our SaaS platform integrates directly with platforms like Apple, Facebook, Google, Instagram and more, and enables multi location brands to effectively manage their presence on them.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

This role has been designated as ‘Edge’, which means you will primarily work outside of an HPE office .

Job Description:

Advance the way you live and work at HPE.

Who We Are:

A career in the HPE GreenLake Platform Cloud (GLCP) team allows you the opportunity to create history and push the industry forward, redefining the state of the art in what cloud computing means. Come and help us build a large scale, enterprise ready platform, powering a hybrid edge-to-cloud world.

Our platform allows some of the largest most diverse enterprises in the world to deliver with speed, agility, and scale – while keeping their data where it... needs to be, and ensuring their sustainability and green goals are met and exceeded.

Our team members search beyond customers' needs today to accelerate what’s next and make a difference — for others, our company, and the planet. Our customers turn to us because we are positive, empathetic and enterprising. Nowhere is this better reflected than in our running in production with over 100,000 dedicated customers and over 1 million devices.

We embrace opportunities to accelerate transformation across data, connectivity, cloud and security. From vital solutions for small businesses with a single storefront to essential applications for large retail chains with thousands of locations. Together we make what was once thought impossible, possible.

What you'll do:

GreenLake Cloud Platform is an internally developed innovative cloud-stack that powers HPE’s Cloud Solutions. The GreenLake Cloud Platform is a unified operational experience that provides a simplified view and access to all cloud services, spanning the entire HPE portfolio, with single sign-on access, security, compliance, elasticity, and data protection.

The GreenLake Cloud Platform is the foundation to a rich set of cloud services in networking, data services, high performance computing and compute operations management.

The GreenLake Cloud Platform team offers the opportunity to apply your knowledge and experience to contribute to architecting and building the platform and applications on a top distributed backend. Be part of a fast-paced development team and learn how to build solutions that make a difference.

Your role will be implementing 'organizations' system. 'Organizations' is a complex data management layer in the architecture that maps customer accounts, partners, HPE employees to physical and virtual device, services and obligations. Security and data privacy are critical at this layer.

As a developer you will integrate into a multisite organization, delivering a large cloud solution, using a scalable agile framework, continuous integration, continuous delivery and ground up test automation. Your team's components will integrate seamlessly with other parts of the platform. You will be required to build 360' relationships within the organization, always creating a meaningful roadmap for your team.

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

With a solid understanding of big data technologies such as Hadoop and Spark, I am capable of handling and processing massive datasets efficiently. I am a critical thinker with a passion for solving complex problems, and I thrive in collaborative environments where I can leverage my skills to drive innovation and make a positive impact.","Senior Data Scientist (Remote, PhD Required)","New York, NY, USA",US$140K–US$170K a year,"Our platform involves ingesting and modeling hundreds of thousands of high-resolution timeseries, updated at 15-minute intervals. We're looking for candidates who have experience building high-velocity machine learning systems from scratch.

• Build advanced timeseries forecasting models at scale. Our customers depend on us to reliably forecast energy demand, both short term and long term, at... micro and macro levels.

• We use a combination of classical timeseries techniques as well as modern ML. We're not big on deep learning, but we're open to the possibility.

• Energy demand and generation both depend on climate and weather, so be prepared to learn lots about meteorology!

• We are primarily Python based, but it's early days, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure.

Our engineering team is still quite small, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure. We are strong supporters of open source and we encourage our employees to publish and give talks about the work they do at Amperon.

Perks

While we are serious about our company’s culture, we aren’t going to force “culture” to prove that we are cool and fun. It’s a company filled with smart, genuinely nice individuals who are passionate about data science, energy and working together to build a product that can have a lasting impact on our planet.

Even though we are a remote company with employees spread across the globe, we still believe human interaction is a good thing. All new employees will fly out to meet their manager within a month of being hired. We will also have an all-company event at least once a year so people can get to know each other in a more fun and social way.

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

Our SaaS platform integrates directly with platforms like Apple, Facebook, Google, Instagram and more, and enables multi location brands to effectively manage their presence on them.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

We're looking for candidates who have experience building high-velocity machine learning systems from scratch.

• Build advanced timeseries forecasting models at scale. Our customers depend on us to reliably forecast energy demand, both short term and long term, at... micro and macro levels.

• We use a combination of classical timeseries techniques as well as modern ML. We're not big on deep learning, but we're open to the possibility.

• Energy demand and generation both depend on climate and weather, so be prepared to learn lots about meteorology!

• We are primarily Python based, but it's early days, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure.

Our engineering team is still quite small, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure. We are strong supporters of open source and we encourage our employees to publish and give talks about the work they do at Amperon.

NOTE PhD required for this role

Perks

While we are serious about our company’s culture, we aren’t going to force “culture” to prove that we are cool and fun. It’s a company filled with smart, genuinely nice individuals who are passionate about data science, energy and working together to build a product that can have a lasting impact on our planet.

Even though we are a remote company with employees spread across the globe, we still believe human interaction is a good thing. All new employees will fly out to meet their manager within a month of being hired. We will also have an all-company event at least once a year so people can get to know each other in a more fun and social way.

"Experienced Data Scientist with a strong background in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. With over 7 years of experience, I specialize in using programming languages such as Python and R to extract insights from complex datasets and drive data-driven decision-making. Proficient in machine learning algorithms and frameworks like TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and PyTorch, I develop predictive models for various applications, including classification, regression, and clustering. Skilled in data preprocessing and feature engineering, I ensure data quality and model performance. Additionally, I have expertise in data visualization libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, creating informative and interactive visualizations that communicate insights effectively. Experienced in working with big data technologies such as Hadoop and Spark, I handle large datasets efficiently and derive actionable insights. A proactive problem solver, I thrive in collaborative environments, leveraging my analytical skills to solve complex business challenges.","Senior Data Scientist (Remote, PhD Required)","New York, NY, USA",US$140K–US$170K a year,"Our platform involves ingesting and modeling hundreds of thousands of high-resolution timeseries, updated at 15-minute intervals. We're looking for candidates who have experience building high-velocity machine learning systems from scratch.

• Build advanced timeseries forecasting models at scale. Our customers depend on us to reliably forecast energy demand, both short term and long term, at... micro and macro levels.

• We use a combination of classical timeseries techniques as well as modern ML. We're not big on deep learning, but we're open to the possibility.

• Energy demand and generation both depend on climate and weather, so be prepared to learn lots about meteorology!

• We are primarily Python based, but it's early days, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure.

Our engineering team is still quite small, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure. We are strong supporters of open source and we encourage our employees to publish and give talks about the work they do at Amperon.

NOTE PhD required for this role

Perks

While we are serious about our company’s culture, we aren’t going to force “culture” to prove that we are cool and fun. It’s a company filled with smart, genuinely nice individuals who are passionate about data science, energy and working together to build a product that can have a lasting impact on our planet.

Even though we are a remote company with employees spread across the globe, we still believe human interaction is a good thing. All new employees will fly out to meet their manager within a month of being hired. We will also have an all-company event at least once a year so people can get to know each other in a more fun and social way.

We're looking for candidates who have experience building high-velocity machine learning systems from scratch.

• Build advanced timeseries forecasting models at scale. Our customers depend on us to reliably forecast energy demand, both short term and long term, at... micro and macro levels.

• We use a combination of classical timeseries techniques as well as modern ML. We're not big on deep learning, but we're open to the possibility.

• Energy demand and generation both depend on climate and weather, so be prepared to learn lots about meteorology!

• We are primarily Python based, but it's early days, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure.

Our engineering team is still quite small, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure. We are strong supporters of open source and we encourage our employees to publish and give talks about the work they do at Amperon.

We're looking for candidates who have experience building high-velocity machine learning systems from scratch.

• Build advanced timeseries forecasting models at scale. Our customers depend on us to reliably forecast energy demand, both short term and long term, at... micro and macro levels.

• We use a combination of classical timeseries techniques as well as modern ML. We're not big on deep learning, but we're open to the possibility.

• Energy demand and generation both depend on climate and weather, so be prepared to learn lots about meteorology!

• We are primarily Python based, but it's early days, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure.

Our engineering team is still quite small, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure. We are strong supporters of open source and we encourage our employees to publish and give talks about the work they do at Amperon.

NOTE PhD required for this role

Perks

While we are serious about our company’s culture, we aren’t going to force “culture” to prove that we are cool and fun. It’s a company filled with smart, genuinely nice individuals who are passionate about data science, energy and working together to build a product that can have a lasting impact on our planet.

Even though we are a remote company with employees spread across the globe, we still believe human interaction is a good thing.

A proactive learner, I stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in frontend development, continuously improving my skills to deliver cutting-edge solutions.",Senior Frontend Developer,"Malmö, Sweden",,"PinMeTo helps businesses connect with their customers on the biggest search, map, and social media platforms. Our SaaS platform integrates directly with platforms like Apple, Facebook, Google, Instagram and more, and enables multi location brands to effectively manage their presence on them.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

Job Description:

Advance the way you live and work at HPE.

Who We Are:

A career in the HPE GreenLake Platform Cloud (GLCP) team allows you the opportunity to create history and push the industry forward, redefining the state of the art in what cloud computing means. Come and help us build a large scale, enterprise ready platform, powering a hybrid edge-to-cloud world.

Our platform allows some of the largest most diverse enterprises in the world to deliver with speed, agility, and scale – while keeping their data where it... needs to be, and ensuring their sustainability and green goals are met and exceeded.

Our team members search beyond customers' needs today to accelerate what’s next and make a difference — for others, our company, and the planet. Our customers turn to us because we are positive, empathetic and enterprising. Nowhere is this better reflected than in our running in production with over 100,000 dedicated customers and over 1 million devices.

We embrace opportunities to accelerate transformation across data, connectivity, cloud and security. From vital solutions for small businesses with a single storefront to essential applications for large retail chains with thousands of locations. Together we make what was once thought impossible, possible.

What you'll do:

GreenLake Cloud Platform is an internally developed innovative cloud-stack that powers HPE’s Cloud Solutions. The GreenLake Cloud Platform is a unified operational experience that provides a simplified view and access to all cloud services, spanning the entire HPE portfolio, with single sign-on access, security, compliance, elasticity, and data protection.

The GreenLake Cloud Platform is the foundation to a rich set of cloud services in networking, data services, high performance computing and compute operations management.

The GreenLake Cloud Platform team offers the opportunity to apply your knowledge and experience to contribute to architecting and building the platform and applications on a top distributed backend. Be part of a fast-paced development team and learn how to build solutions that make a difference.

As a developer you will integrate into a multisite organization, delivering a large cloud solution, using a scalable agile framework, continuous integration, continuous delivery and ground up test automation. Your team's components will integrate seamlessly with other parts of the platform. You will be required to build 360' relationships within the organization, always creating a meaningful roadmap for your team.

The role is technical. You will be required to cultivate your own technical knowledge and create a culture of continuous learning. You will work with supporting R&D functions to help groom requirements and iteratively refine them. You will implement sub-components of the overall solution. You will embrace the organization's continuous test maturation philosophy. Test automation (across all pipelines) supporting the organization's CI/CD model will be part of your DNA.

Continuous learning will be an important part of your development. This will happen through on the job assignment and self investment.

We're looking for candidates who have experience building high-velocity machine learning systems from scratch.

• Build advanced timeseries forecasting models at scale. Our customers depend on us to reliably forecast energy demand, both short term and long term, at... micro and macro levels.

• We use a combination of classical timeseries techniques as well as modern ML. We're not big on deep learning, but we're open to the possibility.

• Energy demand and generation both depend on climate and weather, so be prepared to learn lots about meteorology!

• We are primarily Python based, but it's early days, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure.

Our engineering team is still quite small, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure. We are strong supporters of open source and we encourage our employees to publish and give talks about the work they do at Amperon.

NOTE PhD required for this role

Perks

While we are serious about our company’s culture, we aren’t going to force “culture” to prove that we are cool and fun. It’s a company filled with smart, genuinely nice individuals who are passionate about data science, energy and working together to build a product that can have a lasting impact on our planet.

Even though we are a remote company with employees spread across the globe, we still believe human interaction is a good thing. All new employees will fly out to meet their manager within a month of being hired. We will also have an all-company event at least once a year so people can get to know each other in a more fun and social way.

"Passionate Frontend Developer with a strong foundation in web development and design principles. Proficient in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, with experience in frontend frameworks like React.js and Vue.js. Skilled in building responsive and mobile-friendly web applications. Led projects such as developing interactive data visualization components using D3.js and SVG, and implementing real-time updates using WebSocket communication in React applications. Also contributed to projects including optimizing web accessibility through semantic HTML and ARIA attributes, and implementing client-side routing for single-page applications using React Router. Actively learning about new frontend technologies and design patterns to enhance development skills.",Senior Frontend Developer,"Malmö, Sweden",,"PinMeTo helps businesses connect with their customers on the biggest search, map, and social media platforms. Our SaaS platform integrates directly with platforms like Apple, Facebook, Google, Instagram and more, and enables multi location brands to effectively manage their presence on them.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

Our SaaS platform integrates directly with platforms like Apple, Facebook, Google, Instagram and more, and enables multi location brands to effectively manage their presence on them.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

Additionally, I have experience working with component libraries such as Material-UI and Bootstrap, speeding up development processes while maintaining design consistency. I am a collaborative team player with excellent communication skills, able to work closely with designers and backend developers to bring projects from conception to completion.",Senior Frontend Developer,"Malmö, Sweden",,"PinMeTo helps businesses connect with their customers on the biggest search, map, and social media platforms. Our SaaS platform integrates directly with platforms like Apple, Facebook, Google, Instagram and more, and enables multi location brands to effectively manage their presence on them.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

We're looking for candidates who have experience building high-velocity machine learning systems from scratch.

• Build advanced timeseries forecasting models at scale. Our customers depend on us to reliably forecast energy demand, both short term and long term, at... micro and macro levels.

• We use a combination of classical timeseries techniques as well as modern ML. We're not big on deep learning, but we're open to the possibility.

• Energy demand and generation both depend on climate and weather, so be prepared to learn lots about meteorology!

• We are primarily Python based, but it's early days, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure.

Our engineering team is still quite small, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure. We are strong supporters of open source and we encourage our employees to publish and give talks about the work they do at Amperon.

Perks

While we are serious about our company’s culture, we aren’t going to force “culture” to prove that we are cool and fun. It’s a company filled with smart, genuinely nice individuals who are passionate about data science, energy and working together to build a product that can have a lasting impact on our planet.

Even though we are a remote company with employees spread across the globe, we still believe human interaction is a good thing. All new employees will fly out to meet their manager within a month of being hired. We will also have an all-company event at least once a year so people can get to know each other in a more fun and social way.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

We're looking for candidates who have experience building high-velocity machine learning systems from scratch.

• Build advanced timeseries forecasting models at scale. Our customers depend on us to reliably forecast energy demand, both short term and long term, at... micro and macro levels.

• We use a combination of classical timeseries techniques as well as modern ML. We're not big on deep learning, but we're open to the possibility.

• Energy demand and generation both depend on climate and weather, so be prepared to learn lots about meteorology!

• We are primarily Python based, but it's early days, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure.

Our engineering team is still quite small, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure. We are strong supporters of open source and we encourage our employees to publish and give talks about the work they do at Amperon.

NOTE PhD required for this role

Perks

While we are serious about our company’s culture, we aren’t going to force “culture” to prove that we are cool and fun. It’s a company filled with smart, genuinely nice individuals who are passionate about data science, energy and working together to build a product that can have a lasting impact on our planet.

Even though we are a remote company with employees spread across the globe, we still believe human interaction is a good thing. All new employees will fly out to meet their manager within a month of being hired. We will also have an all-company event at least once a year so people can get to know each other in a more fun and social way.

Our platform allows some of the largest most diverse enterprises in the world to deliver with speed, agility, and scale – while keeping their data where it... needs to be, and ensuring their sustainability and green goals are met and exceeded.

Our team members search beyond customers' needs today to accelerate what’s next and make a difference — for others, our company, and the planet. Our customers turn to us because we are positive, empathetic and enterprising. Nowhere is this better reflected than in our running in production with over 100,000 dedicated customers and over 1 million devices.

We embrace opportunities to accelerate transformation across data, connectivity, cloud and security.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise

Technology innovation that fosters business transformation.

We Are In the Acceleration Business

We help customers use technology to slash the time it takes to turn ideas into value. In turn, they transform industries, markets and lives.

Some of our customers run traditional IT environments. Most are transitioning to a secure, cloud-enabled, mobile-friendly infrastructure. Many rely on a combination of both. Wherever they are in that journey, we provide the technology and solutions to help them succeed.

COVID Policy

The health and safety of our team members, customers and partners is paramount at HPE. Accordingly, if applicable to the role you applied to, you must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by the employment start date where permitted by law.

Edge-to-Office – our hybrid way of working

Edge-to-Office is HPE's hybrid work environment that focuses on flexibility and trust. Most team members work from the edge (primarily outside the office), and some, where deemed essential to performing their role, are allocated a workstation in an HPE office. Regardless of whether a team member is edge or office, all team members are welcome to use our sites for culture and collaboration. Country specific regulations may apply.

We're looking for candidates who have experience building high-velocity machine learning systems from scratch.

• Build advanced timeseries forecasting models at scale. Our customers depend on us to reliably forecast energy demand, both short term and long term, at... micro and macro levels.

• We use a combination of classical timeseries techniques as well as modern ML. We're not big on deep learning, but we're open to the possibility.

• Energy demand and generation both depend on climate and weather, so be prepared to learn lots about meteorology!

• We are primarily Python based, but it's early days, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure.

Our engineering team is still quite small, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure. We are strong supporters of open source and we encourage our employees to publish and give talks about the work they do at Amperon.

NOTE PhD required for this role

Perks

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

"Passionate Data Scientist with a focus on leveraging data to drive strategic decisions and business growth. With 5 years of experience, I specialize in using Python and R for statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Proficient in libraries like pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, I preprocess and explore data to extract meaningful insights. Skilled in machine learning algorithms and frameworks such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow, I develop predictive models for various use cases, including customer segmentation and churn prediction. Additionally, I have experience in deploying models in production using platforms like AWS and Azure, and utilizing version control systems like Git and GitHub. A proactive problem solver, I thrive in collaborative environments, leveraging my analytical skills to solve complex business challenges.","Senior Data Scientist (Remote, PhD Required)","New York, NY, USA",US$140K–US$170K a year,"Our platform involves ingesting and modeling hundreds of thousands of high-resolution timeseries, updated at 15-minute intervals. We're looking for candidates who have experience building high-velocity machine learning systems from scratch.

• Build advanced timeseries forecasting models at scale. Our customers depend on us to reliably forecast energy demand, both short term and long term, at... micro and macro levels.

• We use a combination of classical timeseries techniques as well as modern ML. We're not big on deep learning, but we're open to the possibility.

• Energy demand and generation both depend on climate and weather, so be prepared to learn lots about meteorology!

• We are primarily Python based, but it's early days, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure.

Our engineering team is still quite small, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure. We are strong supporters of open source and we encourage our employees to publish and give talks about the work they do at Amperon.

NOTE PhD required for this role

Perks

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

Our SaaS platform integrates directly with platforms like Apple, Facebook, Google, Instagram and more, and enables multi location brands to effectively manage their presence on them.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

We're looking for candidates who have experience building high-velocity machine learning systems from scratch.

• Build advanced timeseries forecasting models at scale. Our customers depend on us to reliably forecast energy demand, both short term and long term, at... micro and macro levels.

• We use a combination of classical timeseries techniques as well as modern ML. We're not big on deep learning, but we're open to the possibility.

• Energy demand and generation both depend on climate and weather, so be prepared to learn lots about meteorology!

• We are primarily Python based, but it's early days, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure.

Our engineering team is still quite small, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure. We are strong supporters of open source and we encourage our employees to publish and give talks about the work they do at Amperon.

NOTE PhD required for this role

Perks

While we are serious about our company’s culture, we aren’t going to force “culture” to prove that we are cool and fun. It’s a company filled with smart, genuinely nice individuals who are passionate about data science, energy and working together to build a product that can have a lasting impact on our planet.

Even though we are a remote company with employees spread across the globe, we still believe human interaction is a good thing. All new employees will fly out to meet their manager within a month of being hired. We will also have an all-company event at least once a year so people can get to know each other in a more fun and social way.

We're looking for candidates who have experience building high-velocity machine learning systems from scratch.

• Build advanced timeseries forecasting models at scale. Our customers depend on us to reliably forecast energy demand, both short term and long term, at... micro and macro levels.

• We use a combination of classical timeseries techniques as well as modern ML. We're not big on deep learning, but we're open to the possibility.

• Energy demand and generation both depend on climate and weather, so be prepared to learn lots about meteorology!

• We are primarily Python based, but it's early days, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure.

Our engineering team is still quite small, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure. We are strong supporters of open source and we encourage our employees to publish and give talks about the work they do at Amperon.

NOTE PhD required for this role

"Dynamic Frontend Developer with a strong background in frontend technologies and design principles. Proficient in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, with expertise in frameworks like Vue.js and React.js. Skilled in building modular and scalable frontend architectures. Led projects such as redesigning user interfaces for enterprise applications using Vue.js and Vuex for state management, and implementing responsive layouts with CSS Grid and Flexbox. Also contributed to projects including optimizing web accessibility through semantic HTML and ARIA attributes, and integrating internationalization and localization features for multi-language support. Actively participating in frontend hackathons and collaborating with designers to create seamless user experiences.",Senior Frontend Developer,"Malmö, Sweden",,"PinMeTo helps businesses connect with their customers on the biggest search, map, and social media platforms. Our SaaS platform integrates directly with platforms like Apple, Facebook, Google, Instagram and more, and enables multi location brands to effectively manage their presence on them.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

Our SaaS platform integrates directly with platforms like Apple, Facebook, Google, Instagram and more, and enables multi location brands to effectively manage their presence on them.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

We're looking for candidates who have experience building high-velocity machine learning systems from scratch.

• Build advanced timeseries forecasting models at scale. Our customers depend on us to reliably forecast energy demand, both short term and long term, at... micro and macro levels.

• We use a combination of classical timeseries techniques as well as modern ML. We're not big on deep learning, but we're open to the possibility.

• Energy demand and generation both depend on climate and weather, so be prepared to learn lots about meteorology!

• We are primarily Python based, but it's early days, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure.

Our engineering team is still quite small, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure. We are strong supporters of open source and we encourage our employees to publish and give talks about the work they do at Amperon.

Perks

While we are serious about our company’s culture, we aren’t going to force “culture” to prove that we are cool and fun. It’s a company filled with smart, genuinely nice individuals who are passionate about data science, energy and working together to build a product that can have a lasting impact on our planet.

Even though we are a remote company with employees spread across the globe, we still believe human interaction is a good thing. All new employees will fly out to meet their manager within a month of being hired. We will also have an all-company event at least once a year so people can get to know each other in a more fun and social way.

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

We're looking for candidates who have experience building high-velocity machine learning systems from scratch.

• Build advanced timeseries forecasting models at scale. Our customers depend on us to reliably forecast energy demand, both short term and long term, at... micro and macro levels.

• We use a combination of classical timeseries techniques as well as modern ML. We're not big on deep learning, but we're open to the possibility.

• Energy demand and generation both depend on climate and weather, so be prepared to learn lots about meteorology!

• We are primarily Python based, but it's early days, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure.

Our engineering team is still quite small, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure. We are strong supporters of open source and we encourage our employees to publish and give talks about the work they do at Amperon.

NOTE PhD required for this role

Perks

While we are serious about our company’s culture, we aren’t going to force “culture” to prove that we are cool and fun. It’s a company filled with smart, genuinely nice individuals who are passionate about data science, energy and working together to build a product that can have a lasting impact on our planet.

Even though we are a remote company with employees spread across the globe, we still believe human interaction is a good thing. All new employees will fly out to meet their manager within a month of being hired. We will also have an all-company event at least once a year so people can get to know each other in a more fun and social way.

Actively staying updated with the latest frontend technologies and best practices through online courses and workshops.",Senior Frontend Developer,"Malmö, Sweden",,"PinMeTo helps businesses connect with their customers on the biggest search, map, and social media platforms. Our SaaS platform integrates directly with platforms like Apple, Facebook, Google, Instagram and more, and enables multi location brands to effectively manage their presence on them.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

Actively participating in frontend developer meetups and hackathons to stay updated with the latest frontend trends and technologies.",Senior Frontend Developer,"Malmö, Sweden",,"PinMeTo helps businesses connect with their customers on the biggest search, map, and social media platforms. Our SaaS platform integrates directly with platforms like Apple, Facebook, Google, Instagram and more, and enables multi location brands to effectively manage their presence on them.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

Actively staying updated with the latest frontend technologies and design trends through online courses and design blogs.",Senior Frontend Developer,"Malmö, Sweden",,"PinMeTo helps businesses connect with their customers on the biggest search, map, and social media platforms. Our SaaS platform integrates directly with platforms like Apple, Facebook, Google, Instagram and more, and enables multi location brands to effectively manage their presence on them.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

Our SaaS platform integrates directly with platforms like Apple, Facebook, Google, Instagram and more, and enables multi location brands to effectively manage their presence on them.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

Also contributed to projects including integrating third-party UI libraries like Material-UI for faster development cycles, and optimizing web performance through code splitting and lazy loading techniques. Actively engaging in frontend forums and communities to share knowledge and best practices with fellow developers.",Senior Frontend Developer,"Malmö, Sweden",,"PinMeTo helps businesses connect with their customers on the biggest search, map, and social media platforms. Our SaaS platform integrates directly with platforms like Apple, Facebook, Google, Instagram and more, and enables multi location brands to effectively manage their presence on them.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

With over 5 years of experience, I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I have a deep understanding of modern frontend frameworks such as React, Vue.js, and Angular.

My passion for UI/UX design drives me to stay updated with the latest trends and best practices in the industry, allowing me to create visually appealing and intuitive interfaces that engage users. I am a collaborative team player with excellent communication skills, able to work closely with designers, backend developers, and stakeholders to deliver high-quality frontend solutions on time and within budget.",Senior Frontend Developer,"Malmö, Sweden",,"PinMeTo helps businesses connect with their customers on the biggest search, map, and social media platforms. Our SaaS platform integrates directly with platforms like Apple, Facebook, Google, Instagram and more, and enables multi location brands to effectively manage their presence on them.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

"Enthusiastic Data Scientist with a focus on leveraging data to drive strategic decisions and business growth. With 4 years of experience, I specialize in using Python and R for statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Proficient in libraries like pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, I preprocess and explore data to extract meaningful insights. Skilled in machine learning algorithms and frameworks such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow, I develop predictive models for various use cases, including customer segmentation and churn prediction. Additionally, I have experience in deploying models in production using platforms like AWS and Azure. A proactive problem solver, I thrive in collaborative environments, leveraging my analytical skills to solve complex business challenges.","Senior Data Scientist (Remote, PhD Required)","New York, NY, USA",US$140K–US$170K a year,"Our platform involves ingesting and modeling hundreds of thousands of high-resolution timeseries, updated at 15-minute intervals. We're looking for candidates who have experience building high-velocity machine learning systems from scratch.

• Build advanced timeseries forecasting models at scale. Our customers depend on us to reliably forecast energy demand, both short term and long term, at... micro and macro levels.

• We use a combination of classical timeseries techniques as well as modern ML. We're not big on deep learning, but we're open to the possibility.

• Energy demand and generation both depend on climate and weather, so be prepared to learn lots about meteorology!

• We are primarily Python based, but it's early days, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure.

Our engineering team is still quite small, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure. We are strong supporters of open source and we encourage our employees to publish and give talks about the work they do at Amperon.

NOTE PhD required for this role

Perks

It’s a company filled with smart, genuinely nice individuals who are passionate about data science, energy and working together to build a product that can have a lasting impact on our planet.

Even though we are a remote company with employees spread across the globe, we still believe human interaction is a good thing. All new employees will fly out to meet their manager within a month of being hired. We will also have an all-company event at least once a year so people can get to know each other in a more fun and social way.

Who We Are:

A career in the HPE GreenLake Platform Cloud (GLCP) team allows you the opportunity to create history and push the industry forward, redefining the state of the art in what cloud computing means. Come and help us build a large scale, enterprise ready platform, powering a hybrid edge-to-cloud world.

Our platform allows some of the largest most diverse enterprises in the world to deliver with speed, agility, and scale – while keeping their data where it... needs to be, and ensuring their sustainability and green goals are met and exceeded.

Our team members search beyond customers' needs today to accelerate what’s next and make a difference — for others, our company, and the planet. Our customers turn to us because we are positive, empathetic and enterprising. Nowhere is this better reflected than in our running in production with over 100,000 dedicated customers and over 1 million devices.

We embrace opportunities to accelerate transformation across data, connectivity, cloud and security.

We're looking for candidates who have experience building high-velocity machine learning systems from scratch.

• Build advanced timeseries forecasting models at scale. Our customers depend on us to reliably forecast energy demand, both short term and long term, at... micro and macro levels.

• We use a combination of classical timeseries techniques as well as modern ML. We're not big on deep learning, but we're open to the possibility.

• Energy demand and generation both depend on climate and weather, so be prepared to learn lots about meteorology!

• We are primarily Python based, but it's early days, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure.

Our engineering team is still quite small, so the right candidate can have a big impact on our tools and infrastructure. We are strong supporters of open source and we encourage our employees to publish and give talks about the work they do at Amperon.

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

This role has been designated as ‘Edge’, which means you will primarily work outside of an HPE office .

Job Description:

Advance the way you live and work at HPE.

Who We Are:

A career in the HPE GreenLake Platform Cloud (GLCP) team allows you the opportunity to create history and push the industry forward, redefining the state of the art in what cloud computing means. Come and help us build a large scale, enterprise ready platform, powering a hybrid edge-to-cloud world.

Our platform allows some of the largest most diverse enterprises in the world to deliver with speed, agility, and scale – while keeping their data where it... needs to be, and ensuring their sustainability and green goals are met and exceeded.

Our team members search beyond customers' needs today to accelerate what’s next and make a difference — for others, our company, and the planet. Our customers turn to us because we are positive, empathetic and enterprising. Nowhere is this better reflected than in our running in production with over 100,000 dedicated customers and over 1 million devices.

We embrace opportunities to accelerate transformation across data, connectivity, cloud and security. From vital solutions for small businesses with a single storefront to essential applications for large retail chains with thousands of locations. Together we make what was once thought impossible, possible.

What you'll do:

GreenLake Cloud Platform is an internally developed innovative cloud-stack that powers HPE’s Cloud Solutions. The GreenLake Cloud Platform is a unified operational experience that provides a simplified view and access to all cloud services, spanning the entire HPE portfolio, with single sign-on access, security, compliance, elasticity, and data protection.

The GreenLake Cloud Platform is the foundation to a rich set of cloud services in networking, data services, high performance computing and compute operations management.

The GreenLake Cloud Platform team offers the opportunity to apply your knowledge and experience to contribute to architecting and building the platform and applications on a top distributed backend. Be part of a fast-paced development team and learn how to build solutions that make a difference.

Your role will be implementing 'organizations' system. 'Organizations' is a complex data management layer in the architecture that maps customer accounts, partners, HPE employees to physical and virtual device, services and obligations. Security and data privacy are critical at this layer.

As a developer you will integrate into a multisite organization, delivering a large cloud solution, using a scalable agile framework, continuous integration, continuous delivery and ground up test automation. Your team's components will integrate seamlessly with other parts of the platform. You will be required to build 360' relationships within the organization, always creating a meaningful roadmap for your team.

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.
