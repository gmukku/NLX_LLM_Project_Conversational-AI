Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

Our SaaS platform integrates directly with platforms like Apple, Facebook, Google, Instagram and more, and enables multi location brands to effectively manage their presence on them.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

Are you a senior frontend developer with a passion for product development and web technologies? Would you like to be part of a team where collaboration is highly valued and your impact will be much more than just the code you write? We would love to get to know you!

Our Product department consists of 20 talented product people - developers, designers, testers and product managers - working together to discover and deliver the ideal solutions to the most valuable opportunities for both our users and our business. We are organized in small empowered product teams, all co-located at our headquarter office in Malmö, Sweden, each team fully responsible for one of our products.

As we continue to... grow we are now looking for another senior frontend developer to join us. In this role you will play an integral role in both designing our technical solutions as well as ensuring that you and your colleagues have the right conditions to succeed. We expect you to have several years experience of working in teams delivering high quality web applications, with your interests, passion and expertise including everything from design systems and reusable components to automated testing of clean code.

You probably (?) don’t have prior experience with Elm, our language of choice for frontend development, but we think you will be intrigued about the opportunity to learn this functional programming language and apply your previous knowledge to create reliable web applications. In addition to using Elm for frontend you will also work with Node.js and MongoDB for backend development and deploy your solutions to AWS.

With your experience you know how to maximize your impact by balancing your time between raising those around you while at the same time leading the way by writing quality code yourself. You will be involved in everything from mentoring other developers to working closely with designers and product managers in discovery. Face to face collaboration is our standard way of operating as we believe this yields the best results for both our users as well as everyone’s personal development, and for this reason we choose to work together from the office rather than remotely.

If this role sounds interesting to you, submit your application and we will be happy to tell you more about us. Please note that the role is a full time position based at our office in Malmö, Sweden, which means we assume you are located in this region and have a valid work permit for working in Sweden.

What we offer:

In an environment that is filled with skilled and creative colleagues, and a multicultural environment that encourages people to make their ideas happen, you can have an impact like nowhere else. We all help each other to build new skills and best practices through the diversity of our backgrounds and opinions – while having a lot of fun in the process. We invest a lot of time and effort in having a great work environment, such as our Thursday breakfasts, regular hackdays and book circles. You can use an hour every week for workout, a perfect combination with your wellness grant, and occasionally we also have Workout After Work (WAW) together.

We are looking forward to seeing your application! 🧡

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers.

Whitespace was established in 1985 as a software development company specialising in the insurance market. We are a privately owned company and with over 30 years of experience providing carefully designed IT solutions and platforms to our customers in the insurance and reinsurance markets we are in an excellent position to understand our customers, their processes, their challenges and their needs.

We have developed systems that we continue to support proactively for Members’ Agents, Delegated Authority Brokers and Claims Managers.

However, the entire global financial services industry is striving to be more efficient. One obvious way to do this is by digitising and streamlining processes end to end. The insurance market is a prime candidate; moving risks through the distribution chain is expensive and burdened by inefficiencies. Digitisation promises huge benefits to all parties.

In 2016, anticipating this desire for efficiency, Whitespace embarked on a... project to introduce fully digital insurance contract placing into the Lloyd’s of London market. An incumbent system has been trying to do the same thing for years but has struggled to win the hearts and minds of market practitioners. By using new technologies, specifically NoSQL databases and iPads / iPhones, Whitespace has established itself as a strong competitor. The Whitespace Platform launched in August 2019 and has proved extraordinarily popular and successful.

In March 2021 Sequel, a Verisk business, acquired a majority investment in Whitespace. The partnership with Sequel brings an increased set of opportunities for us as an organisation and for our customers. We are excited to be able to fast forward the digital ambition that both Sequel and Whitespace customers desire, and this will see us achieve our seven year ambition in three.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise

Technology innovation that fosters business transformation.

We Are In the Acceleration Business

We help customers use technology to slash the time it takes to turn ideas into value. In turn, they transform industries, markets and lives.

Some of our customers run traditional IT environments. Most are transitioning to a secure, cloud-enabled, mobile-friendly infrastructure. Many rely on a combination of both. Wherever they are in that journey, we provide the technology and solutions to help them succeed.

COVID Policy

The health and safety of our team members, customers and partners is paramount at HPE. Accordingly, if applicable to the role you applied to, you must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by the employment start date where permitted by law. Exemptions based on medical, religious or other grounds will be processed and approved in accordance with local laws.

Edge-to-Office – our hybrid way of working

Edge-to-Office is HPE's hybrid work environment that focuses on flexibility and trust. Most team members work from the edge (primarily outside the office), and some, where deemed essential to performing their role, are allocated a workstation in an HPE office. Regardless of whether a team member is edge or office, all team members are welcome to use our sites for culture and collaboration. Country specific regulations may apply.

Standards of Business Conduct (SBC)

The Hewlett Packard Enterprise Standards of Business Conduct (SBC) embody the fundamental principles that govern our ethical and legal obligations to Hewlett Packard Enterprise. They pertain not only to our conduct within the company but also to conduct involving our customers, channel partners, suppliers and competitors.
